            An agent is something that perceives and acts in an environment. The agent function for an agent specifies the action taken by the agent in response to any percept sequence.
The performance measure evaluates the behavior of the agent in an environment. A rational agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of the performance measure,
given the percept sequence it has seen so far. A task environment specification includes the performance measure, the external en- vironment, the actuators, and the sensors. In designing an agent, the first step must
always be to specify the task environment as fully as possible.Task environments vary along several significant dimensions. They can be fully or partially observable, single-agent or multiagent, deterministic or stochastic, episodic or
sequential, static or dynamic, discrete or continuous, and known or unknown. The agent program implements the agent function. There exists a variety of basic agent-program designs reflecting the kind of information made explicit and used in the
decision process. The designs vary in efficiency, compactness, and flexibility. The appropriate design of the agent program depends on the nature of the environment. Simple reflex agents respond directly to percepts, whereas model-based reflex agents
maintain internal state to track aspects of the world that are not evident in the current percept. Goal-based agents act to achieve their goals, and utility-based agents try to
maximize their own expected “happiness.” All agents can improve their performance through learning.

          <h1>Breadth-first search</h1>
          <small>November, 2022</small>
          <p>
            BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH successors of the root node are expanded next, then their successors, and so on. In general, all the nodes are expanded at a given depth in the search tree before any nodes at the next level are expanded.
Breadth-first search is an instance of the general graph-search algorithm in which the shallowest unexpanded node is chosen for expansion. This is achieved very simply
by using a FIFO queue for the frontier. Thus, new nodes (which are always deeper than their parents) go to the back of the queue, and old nodes, which are shallower than the new nodes,
get expanded first. There is one slight tweak on the general graph-search algorithm, which is that the goal test is applied to each node when it is generated rather than when it is selected for
expansion. This decision is explained below, where we discuss time complexity. Note also that the algorithm, following the general template for graph search, discards any new path to
a state already in the frontier or explored set; it is easy to see that any such path must be at least as deep as the one already found. Thus, breadth-first search always has the shallowest
path to every node on the frontier.
